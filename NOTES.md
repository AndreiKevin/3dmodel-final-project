# BLENDER NOTES

## Useful Tools
### Modifiers
1. Array --> to duplicate objects and offset them
2. Mirror --> to mirror objects
3. Subdivision Surface --> to smooth out objects
4. Solidify --> to give thickness to objects
5. Simple Deform --> to bend objects

## Viewing Tips
shift+h --> to hide everything except the selected mesh
alt+h --> to unhide everything

## Any Mode
shift+d --> duplicate mesh
ctrl+j --> join meshes to a single mesh

ctrl+r --> loop cut --> to cut around the mesh
ctrl+r + scroll --> to add more cuts

Right click + subdivide --> to add more faces to the mesh
alt + left click --> select a loop (of edges)
o --> proportional editing --> to move multiple vertices at once --> used when pulling vertices to create a smooth curve

k --> knife tool --> to cut the mesh manually when edge loop cannot be created anymore (edge loops only work with 4 sided polygons)
gg --> edges slide --> when you want to move just the vertex and not the things around it as well

ctrl+e --> edge menu
ctrl+f --> face menu

## Edge Mode
ctrl+b --> bevel --> to smooth out edges
ctrl+shift+b --> bevel corners --> to smooth out corners

## Faces Mode
i --> inset
e --> extrude
